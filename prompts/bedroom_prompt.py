    ai_rating: A rating from 0 to 5, where 0 means the room is in a terrible condition and 5 means the room is perfectly ready for a guest.
    condition: A single word describing the overall condition of the room (for example: great, messy, tidy, etc.).
    description: A short description of what you see in the image or video, highlighting any positive or negative aspects.

    Make sure to evaluate details like:
    - Whether the bedsheets are properly arranged.
    - If the pillows are neatly placed.
    - Cleanliness of the room.
    - Whether the room appears guest-ready.
